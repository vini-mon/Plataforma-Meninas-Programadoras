# Closure Library

***Closure Library is currently in maintenance mode and will be sunset on August
1, 2024. We no longer see it as meeting the needs of modern JavaScript
development, and we recommend that users look for alternative solutions.***

Please see [#1214](https://github.com/google/closure-library/issues/1214) for
more details.
