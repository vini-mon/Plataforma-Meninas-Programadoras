# @blockly/block-shareable-procedures [![Built on Blockly](https://tinyurl.com/built-on-blockly)](https://github.com/google/blockly)

A set of [Blockly](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blockly) blocks that allow
end-users to define procedures (i.e. functions). These blocks reference explicit
backing data models, which allows them to be more easily manipulated, and shared
between workspaces.

Note that these blocks have the same names as the built-in procedure blocks, so
you can seamlessly upgrade your existing project to use the new blocks.

## Installation

### Yarn

```
yarn add @blockly/block-shareable-procedures
```

### npm

```
npm install @blockly/block-shareable-procedures
```
