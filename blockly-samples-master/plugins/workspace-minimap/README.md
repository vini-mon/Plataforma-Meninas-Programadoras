# @blockly/workspace-minimap [![Built on Blockly](https://tinyurl.com/built-on-blockly)](https://github.com/google/blockly)

A [Blockly](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blockly) plugin that adds a minimap to the workspace. A minimap is a miniature version of your blocks that appears on top of your main workspace. This gives you an overview of what your code looks like, and how it is organized.
There is a focus region within the minimap that highlights the users's current viewport; this is on by default.

## Installation

### Yarn

```
yarn add @blockly/workspace-minimap
```

### npm

```
npm install @blockly/workspace-minimap --save
```

## Usage

### Positioned Minimap

A positioned minimap is an embedded component that lies on top of the primary workspace. When using a PositionedMinimap, the size of the minimap is determined by the window size, and the position by the primary workspace layout configuration.

```js
import * as Blockly from 'blockly';
import {PositionedMinimap} from '@blockly/workspace-minimap';

// Inject Blockly.
const workspace = Blockly.inject('blocklyDiv', {
  toolbox: toolboxCategories,
});

// Initialize plugin.
const minimap = new PositionedMinimap(workspace);
minimap.init();
```

### Unpositioned Minimap

A raw minimap is an object whose size and position is configured using css.

```js
import * as Blockly from 'blockly';
import {Minimap} from '@blockly/workspace-minimap';

// Inject Blockly.
const workspace = Blockly.inject('blocklyDiv', {
  toolbox: toolboxCategories,
});

// Initialize plugin.
const minimap = new Minimap(workspace);
minimap.init();
```

```css
.blockly-minimap {
  position: absolute;
  box-shadow: none;
  width: 200px;
  height: 150px;
  top: 0px;
  left: 50vw;
}
```

### Configuration

The minimap takes a workspace as input and it inherits its RTL and theme properties (so that they don't need to be configured manually).
Additional styling of the minimap is possible with CSS. Use the `blockly-minimap` class for the minimap (box-shadow, etc.) and `blockly-focus-region` for the focus region (fill color, etc.).

## API

- `init`: Initializes the minimap.
- `dispose`: Disposes of the minimap.

- `isFocusEnabled`: Returns whether the focus region is enabled.
- `enableFocusRegion`: Turns on the focus region in the minimap.
- `disableFocusRegion`: Turns off the focus region in the minimap.

The following methods are also accessible with PositionedMinimap instances.

- `position`: Positions the minimap UI element.
- `getBoundingRectangle`: Returns the bounding rectangle of the UI element in
  pixel units relative to the Blockly injection div.
